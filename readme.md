hi this is rickgenere a new vigenere variant i made
it is simple to use
and it can be effective at protecting secret stuff most likely better than normal vigenere since you need to reverse the ricked letters to regular vigenere text then decrypt that

each letter in the ricked text can act as a different letter with different keys
you could use it like a vernam cipher but the key length has to match the plain text length and if you use spaces then you have to also account for them
   plain text: hello how are you the imperial army is comming send help
          key: ljedfhyutgqeruopghtrtfefdvsfbfxcgcbfxvdvcdffdxfsvfdxfvxx
output: GOnna around desert and tell and turn You tell hurt a give NEVER and let AND Never desert NEVER GONNA hurt AND turn NEVER and lie down NEver rickroll around desert up a and around around Never gonna lie rickroll desert GONNA turn down and turn

it tends to get long but its a trade off for a bit more security
if you do use the rickgenere cipher like a vernam cipher dont reuse the key 
destroy it after using it no matter how convinient it is

remember the human is the weakest link in all encryptions
eg: making the password to weak, too short, very common, not keeping it safe and secure and secret, etc
so stay safe and "live long and prosper",-spock
